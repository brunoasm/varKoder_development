# Using Skmer on all-SRA dataset

These are the scripts used in the failed attempt to run Skmer for the all-SRA dataset. We stopped the first run after more than 40 days consuming over 100GB of memory. We also noticed that, even though we request 32 cores, not much more than 1 was used at any single time, so we restarted the run with 8 cores. This has been running for 10 days as of now.

Because skmer does not report progress, we do not know if we are close to finish or not.
