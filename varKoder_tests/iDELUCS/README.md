# Test iDELUCS

[iDELUCS](https://github.com/Kari-Genomics-Lab/iDeLUCS) is a deep-learning based tool for clustering of genomic sequences.

To apply iDELUCS to the Malpighiaceae dataset, we prepared the full plastid+ribosomal nrDNA assembly in `/data/chl_ITS_full` and concatenated sequences of five genes in `/data/gene_markers`. 

To run iDELUCS, execute `iDeLUCS.py`

The accuracy of idelucs ia summarized in `idelucs_accuracy.xlsx`
