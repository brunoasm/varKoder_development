## varKoder_mapping

This folder holds code used to develop the k-mer mapping used in varKodes

## varkoder_design

This folder holds code used to design varKoder and test the effects of training hyperparameters with a dataset of species of Stigmaphyllon

## varkoder_tests

This folders holds codes and results when testing varKoder with broader datasets and comparing to alternative tools

Folders:

other_datasets: tests with 4 species-level datasets

additional_tests_cgr: tests comparing 4 NN architectures and 3 image representations with the Malpighiales dataset

all_SRA_eukaryote_families: tests with all Eukaryote families on NCBI SRA

images_manuscript: files generated for the manuscript

Malpighiales: tests with the Malpighiales dataset

all_SRA_taxa: tests using all taxa available on NCBI SRA

iDELUCS: tests using iDELUCS
